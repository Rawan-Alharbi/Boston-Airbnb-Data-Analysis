## Installations
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

* NumPy

## Project Motivation

Using this dataset I tried to answer these three questions:   
* What are the major factors that influence the price of an Airbnb rental in Boston?   
* Which neighborhoods in Boston have the highest rental prices?   
* What time of year has the highest rental prices?   

## File Descriptions

Dataset used in the analysis is in these two files:

* `Listings`, including full descriptions and average review score.   
* `Calendar`, including listing id and the price and availability for that day.  

Analysis is in: `Boston Airbnb Data Analysis.ipynb` file and saved as html file in `Boston_Airbnb_Data_Analysis.html`.
